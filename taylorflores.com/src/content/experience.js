        "text":"My first exposure to technology as a field of study and work was during my freshman year of high school and I wrote my first lines of code in my sophomore year. During my senior year I participated in the Tech strand of the GO CAPS (**Greater Ozarks Centers for Advanced Professional Studies**). This gave me the opportunity to work on a shuttle management prototype for Big Cedar Lodge of the Branson Area, a project later chosen to be the Technology strandâ€™s representative project at the annual GO CAPS Capstone Showcase. My fellow team member and I then went on to co-found a business based around the continued development of the prototype. Following my graduation from high school, I began working as a Junior Web Developer for Cart32 and attending college. Currently, I am doing AI training for Data Annotations and contract web development work."
